Authorisation
-------------

In order to decrypt various parts of the data stream (see Encryption)
we need to obtain the session decryption key from the web server.  The
two pieces of information needed to request this are the session
number, obtained from the primary key frame, and an authorisation
cookie for a registered user.

There's no magic to obtaining this cookie; registration is currently
free and is performed through a web form that appears when you first
visit the Live Timing section of the Formula 1 website.  Obtaining the
cookie is simply a matter of logging in by placing the e-mail address
and password you registered with in the adjacent web form.

It's therefore quite easy for us to act as a web browser and obtain
the cookie by constructing a POST to the right URL with the e-mail
address and password obtained from the user.  The cookie is returned
in the standard Set-Cookie header.

  --> POST /reg/login.asp HTTP/1.1
      Host: live-timing.formula1.com
      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
      Content-Length: $len

      email=$email&password=$password

  <-- HTTP/1.1 302 Object moved
      Location: http://www.formula1.com/race/livetiming/popup/0.html
      Set-Cookie: USER=$cookie; expires=...

Obviously we're not a web browser so we don't worry about following
the redirect which is intended to give the user the applet now they've
logged in.  We just snatch the user's authorisation cookie out of the
repsonse and move on to the next job.


Our next job is to obtain the decryption key, this is something the
Java applet seems to do itself and is simply a matter of issuing a GET
request to the right URL and getting the response.  The URL has to be
constructed, the filename portion is the session number and the
authorisation cookie is passed as a query parameter.

  --> GET /reg/getkey/$session.asp?auth=$cookie HTTP/1.1
      Host: live-timing.formula1.com

  <-- HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: text/html
      Content-Length: 8

      $key

Ignore the fact the web server thinks it's returning us HTML, the key
is in plain text and consists of 8 hexadecimal digits.
